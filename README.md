# FdF

A 42 project that creates a **3D wireframe model** of a map using **MiniLibX**. It displays a 3D representation of points in isometric projection. `FdF` takes a map file containing coordinates (and optionally color values) and renders a 3D projection using lines to connect points.

## ⚙️ Build

```bash
make
```

This compiles the program into an executable named `fdf`.

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
./fdf <map_file.fdf>
```

### Example

```bash
./fdf maps/42.fdf
```
